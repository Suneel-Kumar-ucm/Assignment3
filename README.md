Create a class Employee and then do the following • Create a data member to count the number of Employees • Create a constructor to initialize name, family, salary, department • Create a function to average salary • Create a Fulltime Employee class and it should inherit the properties of Employee class • Create the instances of Fulltime Employee class and Employee class and call their member functions.
SOLUTION: -->We have created the generic class with name, family, salary and department 
-->And created a data member inorder to counting the number of employees(count_of_employees) 
-->And then defined the constructor with name, family, salary and department to intiliaze the variables
-->And then declared the function in order to calculate the average salary of an employee 
-->and then defined the function inorder to show the details of an employee 
-->And then declared the fulltime employee class inorder to inherit the class properties bu using the super method inorder to intiliaze them. 
-->Then declared the main function inorder to call the functions by giving the values to the variables.

Here is the output of the code: 

The count of an employee is :

2.Using NumPy create random vector of size 20 having only float in the range 1-20. Then reshape the array to 4 by 5 Then replace the max in each row by 0 (axis=1)

SOLUTION: -->In this numpy python program we have imported the numpy package inorder to get the random variables. 
-->used an function in order to replace the maximum value of an array based on the conditions of the axis x and y
-->Then defined the main function inorder to create a random vector of size EX:To sample Unif[a, b): (b - a) * random_sample() + a 
-->And then reshaping the array to 4 by 5 by using the reshape(). -->Moreover, replacing the maximum value in each row by zero.

Here is the output of the code:
